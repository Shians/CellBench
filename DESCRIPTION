Description: This package contains infrastructure for benchmarking analysis 
    methods and access to single cell mixture benchmarking data. It provides
    a framework for organising analysis methods and testing combinations of
    methods in a pipeline without explicitly laying out each combination. It
    also provides utilities for sampling and filtering SingleCellExperiment
    objects, constructing lists of functions with varying parameters, and
    multithreaded evaluation of analysis methods.
